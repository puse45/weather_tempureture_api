# Weather API Challenge

This is an django API application that allows a user to get the minimum, maximum, average and median temperature for a given city and period of time.

* Django application must run locally
* API must be in the format /api/locations/{city}/?days={number_of_days}
* API must fetch weather data from some public API of your choice
* API must compute min, max, average, and median temperature
* Response format must be in the following structure:

```json
{
  "maximum": "value",
  "minimum": "value",
  "average": "value",
  "median": "value"
}
```
